# Presentation Script for NotebookLM Demo

## Introduction

"Thank you! Good afternoon everyone! I'm excited to show you how NotebookLM can interact with documents using AI. NotebookLM is a tool similar to PKC."

## Step 1: Creating a Notebook Before Meeting

"Before we begin, I've already prepared a notebook with multiple sources."

## Step 2: Main Page Interface

"Here's the main page where you can see all your notebooks. Let me open the notebook."

## Step 3: Added Sources

"I've uploaded {your_notebook_number} sources and I can add documents, books, articles from various sources, but this is limited to 50 sources. You can see all the sources listed here in the left panel."

## Step 4: View the Source

"Let's take a look at one of these sources."

## Step 5: Ask Questions to the AI

"Now, here's where it gets interesting. Instead of searching through long reports, books, or articles, I can simply ask questions: What is Authentik? (First Question) and What is the relationships between Authentik and MVP Cards? (Second Question)" 

**While waiting for the process.**

## Step 6: Check the Answer

"The AI has analyzed all sources and provided this comprehensive answer. Notice how it cites specific sources and even shows you the relevant sections. You spend less time searching and more time learning."

## Step 7: Showing Studio (Right Top) Features

"Let me show you some of the features in NotebookLM Studio:"
- "The Audio Overview can read through the points for us."
- "The Video Overview creates a video summary."
- "The Mind Map feature shows how concepts are connected."
- "Last but not least, the Reports feature generates a summary of all the sources I have added."

**NOTE: IF THE STUDIO GENERATE FEATURES IS SLOW, DISTRACT BY EXPLAINING SOMETHING ELSE OR ASKING THE AI.**

## Closing

"And that's a quick overview of how NotebookLM works. Now, I'd like to hand it over to Henry. Thank you! Henry please continue."

# Presentation Script for IoT

## Introduction
Thank you!

What is IoT? IoT stands for Internet of Things as Duwi said before. With IoT we can connect physical world devices to the internet and AI so we can collect real-time data, see the status, and control them remotely.

Here’s what our system can do with IoT:

* **GPS Tracker**: We can see the exact location, speed, and direction of a vehicle, device, or house in PKC.
* **Lamp Control**: Directly fr-om the map, we can turn on or turn off the lamp with one click—perfect for saving energy.
* **Energy Meter**: Shows how much electricity is being used, including voltage, current, and power, helping us manage energy consumption.
* **Temperature Sensor**: Monitors temperature and humidity, useful for agriculture, storage, or weather checks.
* **Air Quality Sensor**: Measures pollution levels, so we know when the air is safe.
* **Humidity Sensor**: Tracks soil moisture and temperature for farming or environmental monitoring.

**Connecting IoT with AI in PKC, we can predict and do something with the device.**

**In short, IoT Map Tracker in PKC makes it easy for you to monitor, control, and analyze devices from anywhere, helping you save time, energy, and resources.**
