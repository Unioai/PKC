# Debounced Search Pattern

## Overview

The **Debounced Search** pattern improves user experience by automatically triggering search operations after a brief pause in typing, rather than requiring users to explicitly click a search button. This pattern is commonly used in modern web applications to create responsive, real-time search experiences.

## Key Characteristics

1. **Auto-triggering**: Search executes automatically after user stops typing
2. **Character threshold**: Only triggers when input reaches a minimum length (typically 3+ characters)
3. **Debounce delay**: Waits for a brief pause in typing (typically 300-800ms) before executing
4. **Input validation**: Prevents unnecessary API calls for very short queries

## Implementation in PKC

The PKC application implements debounced search with the following specifications:

- **Minimum character threshold**: 3 characters
- **Debounce delay**: 500ms (0.5 seconds)
- **Implementation**: React hooks (useState, useRef, useEffect)
- **Backup**: Search button remains available for explicit searches

## How It Works

1. User begins typing in the search field
2. Input is captured and stored in component state
3. A debounce timer starts/resets with each keystroke
4. When typing pauses for 500ms AND the query is 3+ characters:
   - The timer completes
   - Search function executes automatically
5. If typing resumes before the timer completes:
   - Previous timer is canceled
   - A new timer starts

## Code Pattern

```tsx
// 1. Set up state and refs
const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState("");
const debounceTimerRef = useRef<NodeJS.Timeout | null>(null);

// 2. Create handler with debounce logic
const handleSearchInput = (value: string) => {
  // Update state immediately
  setSearchQuery(value);
  
  // Clear any pending timer
  if (debounceTimerRef.current) {
    clearTimeout(debounceTimerRef.current);
  }
  
  // Only trigger search for queries with 3+ characters
  if (value.length >= 3) {
    debounceTimerRef.current = setTimeout(() => {
      // Execute search
      performSearch(value);
    }, 500); // 0.5 second delay
  }
};

// 3. Clean up on component unmount
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    if (debounceTimerRef.current) {
      clearTimeout(debounceTimerRef.current);
    }
  };
}, []);
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved UX**: Users see results as they type without clicking buttons
2. **Reduced API load**: Prevents excessive API calls by waiting for typing to pause
3. **Bandwidth efficiency**: Avoids searching very short queries that would return too many results
4. **Progressive enhancement**: Search button still available as fallback

## When To Use

Debounced search is ideal for scenarios where:

- Search results should update in near real-time
- The search operation is moderately expensive (API calls, database queries)
- User input typically involves several characters typed in sequence
- Immediate feedback improves user experience

## Alternatives

- **Throttling**: Executes at regular intervals during typing (vs. waiting for pause)
- **Instant search**: Triggers on every keystroke (may cause performance issues)
- **Manual search**: Only executes when explicitly triggered by button click

## Further Improvements

- Add loading indicators during search execution
- Implement keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Esc to clear)
- Consider caching recent search results
- Add analytics to track search behavior
